A mod for Factorio that adds a special combinator for use with the [Project Cybersyn][cybersyn] mod.

For more information on the mod features, check out the [information file](src/information.md).
(The text in the information file is what's used for the mod portal description.)

## Usage

 1. Install mod
 2. Craft the new "Cybersyn constant combinator"
 3. Place it like you would a regular constant combinator
 4. Configure the signals in it
 5. Hook it up to a Cybernetic combinator from [the Project Cybersyn mod][cybersyn]
 6. You're done!

## Development

 1. Clone repo somewhere.
 2. Symlink to the `src` folder from your Factorio mods folder

    Linux example:

    ```sh
    ln -s ~/repos/github.com/Sharparam/cybersyn-combinator/src ~/factorio/mods/cybersyn-combinator
    ```

    Windows example (powershell):

    ```pwsh
    New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\factorio\mods\cybersyn-combinator" -Value "$env:USERPROFILE\repos\github.com\Sharparam\cybersyn-combinator\src"
    ```
  3. Open the repo folder in VS Code or your favourite editor
  4. Hack away!

## Acknowledgements

A lot was gained from looking at how the [LTN Combinator Modernized][ltnc] mod does things, so big thanks are due to that mod for getting up and running with the Cybersyn version.
